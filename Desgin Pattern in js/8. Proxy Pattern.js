// Certainly! The Proxy pattern in JavaScript provides a way to control access to an object by creating a proxy object that acts as an intermediary. Here's a simple example that demonstrates the Proxy pattern in JavaScript:

// ```javascript
// Real subject
class BankAccount {
  constructor(initialBalance) {
    this.balance = initialBalance;
  }

  deposit(amount) {
    this.balance += amount;
    console.log(`Deposited ${amount}. New balance is ${this.balance}`);
  }

  withdraw(amount) {
    if (amount <= this.balance) {
      this.balance -= amount;
      console.log(`Withdrawn ${amount}. New balance is ${this.balance}`);
    } else {
      console.log("Insufficient balance");
    }
  }
}

// Proxy
class BankAccountProxy {
  constructor(initialBalance) {
    this.bankAccount = new BankAccount(initialBalance);
  }

  deposit(amount) {
    // Additional logic can be added here
    
    this.bankAccount.deposit(amount);
  }

  withdraw(amount) {
    // Additional logic can be added here
    this.bankAccount.withdraw(amount);
  }
}

// Usage
const account = new BankAccountProxy(1000);
account.deposit(500);
account.withdraw(2000);
// ```

// In this example, we have a `BankAccount` class representing a real bank account, and a `BankAccountProxy` class representing a proxy for the bank account. The proxy class controls access to the real object.

// The proxy class `BankAccountProxy` has the same interface as the real `BankAccount` class, with methods like `deposit` and `withdraw`. The proxy class creates an instance of the real `BankAccount` class and delegates the method calls to it.

// You can add additional logic in the proxy class, such as checking user permissions, logging, or caching. In this example, the proxy doesn't add any additional logic, but you can easily extend it to incorporate such behavior.

// By using the proxy, you can control the access to the real bank account object and perform additional operations before or after executing the methods on the real object.
