// Certainly! Here's an example of implementing the Observer Pattern in JavaScript:

// ```javascript
// Subject (Observable)
class NewsPublisher {
  constructor() {
    this.subscribers = []; // List of subscribers
  }

  // Method to subscribe a new observer
  subscribe(observer) {
    this.subscribers.push(observer);
  }

  // Method to unsubscribe an observer
  unsubscribe(observer) {
    this.subscribers = this.subscribers.filter(subscriber => subscriber !== observer);
  }

  // Method to notify all subscribers
  notify(message) {
    this.subscribers.forEach(subscriber => subscriber.update(message));
  }
}

// Observer
class NewsSubscriber {
  constructor(name) {
    this.name = name;
  }

  // Method called by the subject when a new message is available
  update(message) {
    console.log(`${this.name} received news: ${message}`);
  }
}

// Usage
const publisher = new NewsPublisher();

const subscriber1 = new NewsSubscriber('Subscriber 1');
const subscriber2 = new NewsSubscriber('Subscriber 2');
const subscriber3 = new NewsSubscriber('Subscriber 3');

publisher.subscribe(subscriber1);
publisher.subscribe(subscriber2);
publisher.subscribe(subscriber3);

publisher.notify('Breaking news: JavaScript wins award!');
// Output:
// Subscriber 1 received news: Breaking news: JavaScript wins award!
// Subscriber 2 received news: Breaking news: JavaScript wins award!
// Subscriber 3 received news: Breaking news: JavaScript wins award!

publisher.unsubscribe(subscriber2);

publisher.notify('Latest update: New JavaScript framework released!');
// Output:
// Subscriber 1 received news: Latest update: New JavaScript framework released!
// Subscriber 3 received news: Latest update: New JavaScript framework released!
// ```

// In the above example, we have a `NewsPublisher` class that serves as the subject or observable. It maintains a list of subscribers (observers) in the `subscribers` array. It provides methods to subscribe, unsubscribe, and notify the subscribers.

// The `NewsSubscriber` class represents the observers. Each subscriber has a `name` and an `update` method. When the `NewsPublisher` calls the `notify` method, it iterates over all subscribers and calls their respective `update` method, passing the news message as a parameter.

// In the usage section, we create an instance of the `NewsPublisher` and three instances of the `NewsSubscriber`. We subscribe all three subscribers to the publisher. When the publisher's `notify` method is called with a news message, all subscribers are notified and their `update` method is invoked.

// By using the Observer Pattern, the subject (publisher) and observers (subscribers) are loosely coupled. The subscribers can register or unregister dynamically, and the publisher can notify all subscribers without knowing their specific details. This pattern enables a flexible and decoupled communication mechanism between objects in JavaScript.
