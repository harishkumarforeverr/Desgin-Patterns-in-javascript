// Certainly! Here's a simple example of implementing the Singleton Pattern in JavaScript:

// ```javascript
const Singleton = (function () {
  let instance; // Private variable to hold the single instance

  function createInstance() {
    // Private method to create the instance
    const object = new Object("I am the singleton instance");
    return object;
  }

  return {
    getInstance: function () {
      if (!instance) {
        // If instance doesn't exist, create a new one
        instance = createInstance();
      }
      return instance;
    },
  };
})();

// Usage
const instance1 = Singleton.getInstance();
console.log(instance1); // Output: Object('I am the singleton instance')

const instance2 = Singleton.getInstance();
console.log(instance2); // Output: Object('I am the singleton instance')

console.log(instance1 === instance2); // Output: true (Both instances are the same)
// ```

// In the above example, we define a Singleton object using an immediately invoked function expression (IIFE). The `createInstance` function is a private method that creates a new instance of the object. The `getInstance` method is exposed publicly and serves as the entry point to access the singleton instance.

// When `getInstance` is called, it checks if the `instance` variable is already set. If not, it creates a new instance using the `createInstance` function. The same instance is then returned on subsequent calls to `getInstance`, ensuring that only one instance of the object is created.

// By using the Singleton Pattern, we can guarantee that there is only one instance of the object throughout the application. This can be useful in scenarios where we want to share a single resource or maintain a global state that should be accessed consistently.
