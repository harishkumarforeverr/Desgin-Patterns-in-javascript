In JavaScript, there are several design patterns that are commonly used to structure and organize code. Here are some of the most frequently employed design patterns in JavaScript:

1. Singleton Pattern: Ensures that a class has only one instance and provides a global point of access to it.

2. Module Pattern: Encapsulates private members and provides a way to expose public members. It helps in achieving modularity and code organization.

3. Factory Pattern: Provides an interface for creating objects without specifying their concrete classes. It allows the creation of objects based on certain conditions.

4. Observer Pattern: Defines a one-to-many dependency between objects. When one object changes state, all its dependents are notified and updated automatically.

5. Prototype Pattern: Allows the creation of objects based on a template or prototype. It avoids the need for creating new instances by cloning existing ones.

6. Decorator Pattern: Dynamically adds new behaviors to objects by wrapping them in a decorator class. It provides a flexible alternative to subclassing.

7. Iterator Pattern: Provides a way to access elements of an aggregate object sequentially without exposing its underlying structure.

8. Proxy Pattern: Controls access to another object by providing a surrogate or placeholder. It can be used to add additional functionality or perform optimizations.

9. Command Pattern: Encapsulates a request as an object, allowing parameterization of clients with different requests and supporting undoable operations.

10. MV\* Patterns (MVC, MVP, MVVM): These are architectural patterns that separate the concerns of an application into different components, such as models, views, and controllers/presenters/view models. They help in achieving separation of concerns and maintainability.

These are just a few examples of design patterns commonly used in JavaScript. There are other design patterns as well, but these are some of the most widely applied ones in JavaScript development.
